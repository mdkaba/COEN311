### Lab Assignments
[Lab 1: Intel x86 Assembly Programming](https://github.com/mdkaba/COEN311/tree/main/Lab%201-%20COEN311)

Goals:
- Gain familiarity with using the NASM assembler and the LD loader to generate executable programs from Intel x86 assembly language source code.
- Learn to single-step through programs using the GDB command-line debugger.

  
[Lab 2: Intel x86 Addressing Modes and Advanced Tool Exploration](https://github.com/mdkaba/COEN311/tree/main/Lab%202-%20COEN311)

Goals:
- Introduce various Intel x86 addressing modes, which determine how assembly language instructions access data operands.
- Explore additional features of the NASM assembler, GDB debugger, and other Linux utilities.

[Lab 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations and Two-Dimensional Array Manipulation](https://github.com/mdkaba/COEN311/tree/main/Lab%203-%20COEN311)

Goals:
- Gain proficiency in basic arithmetic operations within the context of assembly language programming.
- Apply knowledge of addressing modes and arithmetic operations to write assembly language programs capable of accessing elements in a two-dimensional array of integers stored in memory.

  
[Lab 4: Flow Control and String Manipulation in Intel x86 Assembly Language](link_to_lab4)

Goals:
- Develop an understanding of flow control assembly language statements, including unconditional and conditional jumps, as well as compare instructions.
- Acquire familiarity with the string display int 80h interrupt routine.
- Apply these concepts to write a comprehensive Intel x86 assembly language program capable of converting a string of characters into uppercase.
